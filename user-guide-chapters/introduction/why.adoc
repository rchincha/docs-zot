== Why {zotLowerName}?

Unlike {zotUpperName}, many commonly-used image registries do not fully conform to the
https://github.com/opencontainers/distribution-spec[OCI Distribution Specification].

The following table compares the capabilities of {zotLowerName} with another common
image registry.

NOTE: * The *minimal build* feature is the ability to build a minimal
distribution-spec compliant registry in order to reduce library dependencies
and the possible attack surface.
